Silver federated search framework
=================================

Silver is a simple federated search framework written in *node.js*. It can take a text query and search several providers then combine the results. Queries can be passed to a URL and returned as a JSON document or sent via *socket.io* where results can be sent to the client application as they arrive. It is possible to write search plugins for the system and an example that searches [ATLAS](http://atlas.metabroadcast.com/) is included.


INSTALLATION
------------

Use *npm* to install [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [restler](https://github.com/danwrong/restler) as these are both required by Silver to function. You should also have an up to date version of node.js installed.


RUNNING
-------

Check the configuration in the config.js file and change according to your requirements and then run the server from the command line with:
    
    node silver-server.js

More options are available by running:
    
    node silver-server.js --help


QUERYING VIA A URL
------------------
Call the /search.json endpoint with a 'q' GET parameter with a URL encoded string of your query, e.g.
    
    /search.json?q=my%20query


QUERYING VIA SOCKET.IO
----------------------
You can call the server through socket.io and have the server send the results as it gets them. 
Connect to the server with:
    
    var socket = io.connect([SERVER URL]);

Send the search with:
    
    socket.emit('search', {
        q :[THE QUERY],
    });

Handle the results with callbacks like this:
    
    socket.on('result', function(data) {
        // display the result
    });

When all results are in this is called:
    
    socket.on('results_finished', function(data) {
        console.log("Results finished. There should be " + data + " result(s)");
    });


WRITING A SEARCH PLUGIN
-----------------------
Adding search providers to Silver is relatively straightforward. An example is included to help you get started under [/search_modules/AtlasSearch.js](search_modules/AtlasSearch.js).

Silver loads the search plugins found at the paths in the searchProviders array in the [config.js](config.js) file. Specify the path to your search module here as you would if you were using  a require() call in node.js.

When a query is performed an initialisation function is called on your module. This take the following form:
    
    var MySearch = function(q, config, fn)
    
The parameters are:
  q - the search string
  config - a section from the config.js file with the same name as the module file name. This should contain any settings your module needs such as API keys.
  fn - this is a callback function generated by Silver that you should call for every result (see below).

Your module should also contain a function that looks like this:
MySearch.prototype.run = function() {}

This should return a SearchResult object (see modules/SearchResult) and call the fn callback in the following ways:

For a result:

    fn(SearchResult_object, false)

When your module has finished generating results:

    fn([Name of your module], true)


Don't forget to export your module with __module.exports__ at the end of the file.
